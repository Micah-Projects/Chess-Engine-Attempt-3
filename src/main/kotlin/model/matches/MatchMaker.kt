/*
The match maker class will be used to host games between two bodies. These bodies may be any of:
    -> user with gui
    -> user with terminal
    -> bot/engine
These games may be timed. The matchmaker can run batches of games simultaneously, or sequentially. these batches, once
complete, yield a result, where statistical data such as winner/loser body, color, quantity of each end status
result are all stored. Games can be started from a constant position, or a sequence of positions, and have specific timers for each player.
